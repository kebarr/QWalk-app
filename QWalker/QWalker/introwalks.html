        <p> Discrete time quantum walks are analogues of
classical random walks, which evolve in ways which are consistent with
the laws of <a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qm/#PhySta">quantum mecahnics</a>. Roughly that means that their evolution
is time reversible, or it doesn't matter what direction you run time
            in, and classical notions such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_superposition">being in one place or state at a time</a>, or having <a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qt-uncertainty/">simultaneously defined momentum and position</a>, don't apply.
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_walk"> Classical
random walks </a>evolve accoring to two operations, a coin flip and a
shift. The coin flip tells you whether to go left or right, usually
with equal probability of either. The shift then moves you. Its the
same for a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_walk">
quantum walk,</a> except the coin makes you go both left and right at the same
time. The fact that you go a little bit left, and a little bit right,
on each step of the walk (as shown in the image below), combined with interference, means that the
quantum walk moves you along the line much faster than the classical
random walk. This makes sense given that with a classical random walk,
your expected position at every time step is exactly where you
started!</p>

<p>In fact, the walk on the line, the one I've shown you, is quite
boring. And it was <a
href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=380757">solved analytically </a>
in 2001, which given the
research communities justified preference for analytical rather than
numerical results, makes simulating them quite pointless. More
interestingly, you can define quantum walks over arbitrary structures,
such as these:</p>

<p>There are two main threads to research into discrete time quantum
walks, looking at transport properties-where they go, and how fast-
and their algorithmic applications. In fact, their good transport
properties are taken advantage of in <a href = "http://arxiv.org/abs/quantph/0403120">algorithmic applications</a>, so we
can basically boil it down to one application. <a href = "http://arxiv.org/abs/0910.1024">Any algorithm can be
computed by a discrete time quantum walk, as they are computationally
universal,</a> hence they are considered computational 
primitives. That means that the can perform any quantum computation to
arbitrary precision. This was shown by using them to simulate <a href
= "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_circuit ">quantum
circuits.</a> More recently, <a href = "http://arxiv.org/abs/1209.5238">I used them to solve language
recognition problems. </a> </p>

<p><b>Disclaimer: this is a horribly imprecise and swift introduction to
discrete time quantum walks. This is on the basis that I don't think
lay people want to know what a state vector is or are too bothered
about how to guarantee unitarity. If you are bothered, please consult
<a href = "http://arxiv.org/abs/1204.5937">any research paper with a
decent introduction to quantum walks.</a> If you're really really
bothered, apply for a PhD in quantum information. It will be the best
and worst four years of your life. For a general introduction to quantum information theory, <a href="http://www.quantiki.org/wiki/Main_Page">quantiki</a> is great</b></p>
